# How to Use the Aletha Knowledge Base

Once installed, just talk to Claude naturally. The knowledge base works in the background.

## Quick Examples

**Find information:**
> "Search the knowledge base for brand guidelines"
> "What's our PTO policy?"
> "Find the onboarding checklist"

**Create content:**
> "Write a marketing email using our brand voice"
> "Draft a social post following our guidelines"

**Browse documents:**
> "What documents are in the knowledge base?"
> "Show me what's in the Marketing folder"

## Available Commands

| What you want | How to ask Claude |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Search for a topic | "Search the knowledge base for [topic]" |
| Read a specific doc | "Read the [document name]" |
| Browse folders | "List what's in the knowledge base" |
| See core docs | "What are the core documents?" |

## Tips

- **Be specific** - "Search for social media guidelines" works better than "find stuff about social"
- **Ask follow-ups** - After Claude finds a doc, ask it to summarize or use the information
- **Reference by name** - If you know the document name, just ask for it directly

## That's It

No special syntax needed. Ask Claude about company topics and it will automatically search and read from the knowledge base to give you accurate, Aletha-specific answers.
